# EncodedIRSensor

This is for making cheap infrared sensors (such as those purchased via Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress) more reliable by modulating them and validating the transmitter against what the receiver sees in a rolling window.

This can help overcome the issues caused by varying degrees of natural and unnatural lighting.
