# EncodedIRSensor

This is for making cheap infrared sensors (such as those purchased via Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress) more reliable by modulating an encoded value at a specific frequency, and checking to ensure the receiver is only receiving that specific value at the same frequency.

This can help overcome the issues caused by varying degrees of natural and unnatural lighting.
