*   Using cheap AliExpress IR sensors
*   These sensors set an input pin low when activated in reflection mode
*   In beam break mode, therefore, they will set an input pin high when activated
*   Experimentation shows the receiver takes several microseconds to respond to
*   a change in state, therefore a delay of 20 microseconds is added to compensate
