#include <Arduino.h>

// Transmitter Setup:

// Connect the anode (longer leg) of the IR LED to a digital output pin on the Arduino (e.g., Pin 3).
// Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the IR LED to a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220 ohms).
// Connect the other end of the current-limiting resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.

// Receiver Setup:

// Connect the collector of the IR phototransistor to the 5V pin on the Arduino through a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10k ohms).
// Connect the emitter of the IR phototransistor to a digital input pin on the Arduino (e.g., Pin 2).
// Connect a capacitor (e.g., 1uF) between the digital input pin and GND to filter out noise.
//

// // Encoder
//
// To encode a signal with a simple number without using a library, you can use a basic encoding scheme like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). In this method, you can represent the data by varying the width of the pulses of the IR signal. For example, you can use a longer pulse for a binary "1" and a shorter pulse for a binary "0."

// Here's a basic example of how to encode a simple number (e.g., 5) and transmit it using an IR LED connected to an Arduino.

// This example will transmit the number 5 using PWM encoding. Adjust the pulseWidthHigh and pulseWidthLow variables to control the width of the pulses and, consequently, the encoding. You'll need to use a corresponding decoding algorithm on the receiving side to interpret the pulses and extract the encoded number.

// Keep in mind that this example is a simple illustration, and in real-world applications, you may need to consider error checking, synchronization, and other factors to ensure reliable data transmission and reception. Using more advanced encoding schemes and error-checking methods would be necessary for robust and error-resistant communication.
//

// // Decoder (phototransistor)
//
// To decode the transmitted signal using the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) encoding example provided earlier, you would need a receiving algorithm that measures the time durations of the incoming pulses and then interprets these durations to reconstruct the original encoded number. Here's a basic decoding algorithm for the given PWM encoding scheme.

// In this decoding algorithm, the Arduino waits for the start signal from the transmitter using waitForStartSignal(). Once the start signal is received, it proceeds to receive and decode the number using receiveNumber(). The function receiveNumber() measures the time durations of the incoming pulses and interprets them to reconstruct the original encoded number.

// Please note that this is a basic example for educational purposes, and in real-world applications, you may need to add error checking, synchronization, and other measures to ensure reliable data transmission and reception. More advanced encoding and decoding methods are necessary for robust and error-resistant communication.
